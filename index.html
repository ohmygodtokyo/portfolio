      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Michael Nhye, and I am no thing—not nothing, but no thing.</p>
      <p>
        My interest in software engineering began during my time as a music producer. At some point, I remember thinking to myself, “One day, I’d like to build my own audio plugins.” That thought sparked a curiosity that led me to start learning the C language. I can’t quite recall which version of C I picked up first, but I know it was one of them.

        Every day, I studied on Codecademy. I wasn’t entirely sure what I was doing or whether I was even on the right path, but that’s where my journey started.

        Eventually, I enrolled at Le Wagon, where I learned Ruby. While I genuinely enjoyed the language and the experience, I found myself frustrated by the separation between backend and frontend technologies — writing Ruby in the backend and JavaScript in the frontend never quite felt cohesive to me.

        That’s what led me to make a full transition. Today, I’m focused on becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer, committed to mastering a unified language across the stack.
